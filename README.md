## YueS GUI components for Node.js and Deno

Basic set of GUI components for YueS GUI server (intended to be used with Node.js or Deno libs).  
Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) without external dependencies.  
It's meant to be used as a dependency while creating your own high-level GUI libraries. It's recommended not to use this library directly in your apps.  
Builds itself using [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev).
